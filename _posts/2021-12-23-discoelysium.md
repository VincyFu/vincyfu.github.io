# 1 Game Mechanics

For TRPG fans, _Disco Elysium_ is certainly dear to their hearts, even though TRPG are only the most superficial of experiences in this game.  

_Disco Elysium_ has been described as a milestone for CRPGs, but it is subversive in its gameplay by departing from the previous paradigm of CRPGs. It sacrifices strategy and action, by introducing a TRPG-like adjudication model and placing a premium on worldview values, and role-playing immersion, which together create an organisational effect that differs from the traditional quest orientation.  

The characters are initially set up similarly to TRPGs, but simpler, only needing to choose their archetype and set signature skills, which will allow for subsequent access to clues in different ways. Also, what makes it more special than a realistic and flexible TRPG is that after completing the various side quests, the player's values can grow and it will be easier to go back and adjudicate actions that were not passed before.  

The game can be saved and loaded (S/L) at key decisions, and in unpredictable conversations, players can choose to follow their heart or the logic of the clues presented so far. The authenticity of the game is also reflected in the fact that there is no perfect, unique solution. A perfect one-time determination doesn't necessarily lead to a smooth ending, and a determination that hits the wall time and time again isn't necessarily a bad thing - A reliable colleague, Kim, will bring you direction.  

As an RPG, the biggest controversy with _Disco Elysium_ is that it has little replay value, but that is precisely what makes it so special - the immersion into a grand world through the experience of just one playthrough. As it steps outside of the previously defined paradigm, it is likewise expanding the boundaries of what an RPG can be.  


# 2 Game Play Experience: Finding yourself and Understanding reality

## 2.1 The Constructed Self

My initial impression of _Disco Elysium_ was eccentric: the eccentric protagonist - a middle-aged man with a hangover and amnesia, who knows nothing about himself and learns through others that he is a policeman with a badly dressed but seemingly reliable colleague, whose common purpose is to investigate a corpse hanging from a tree.  

The player's initial aim is to know who I am, where I come from and where I am going. In this unknown world, full of newness, contradictions, conflicts and madness, the player learns about himself and about this "strange" world. In dialogue with others and in exploration of the world, the protagonist discovers that his name is Harrier Du Bois, a former star policeman, and that he was, and still is, a sober alcoholic and drug addict when he sees drugs and bottles of alcohol and "gets a taste for them". The traces in the hotel room and on the floor of the harbour are all signs of a previous night of partying. But more than that, the position depends on the player's own choices.  

While it is initially thought that the ultimate goal of the entire game is to investigate the killer of the corpse, the player gradually discovers that the murder is just the tip of the iceberg, a warning, a trigger, behind which lies a complex conflict of interest, the front end of a great dispute. Harrier and Kim Kitsuragi, as police officers, eventually eliminate the "disguised" killer and find the real one, but by then it doesn't matter who, why and how.  

At the end, we have collected many pieces of people and things from this world and put together a complete self. From the hungover state of a blank sheet of paper to a realistic portrayal of what it looks like to be grounded in this world as a self. Although still in a tangled, complicated, frantic and frustrated state at the end, we come to terms with ourselves as such anyway.  

## 2.2 Game and Reality

Disco Elysium, as a game, brings the player a story that is more realistic than reality. A reality that has its roots in the Soviet Union, exists in Eastern Europe now, and will most likely be present anywhere in the future.  

This reality is - the broken walls of Martinaise in 1951, the chaotic neighbourhoods, the rubbish and drugs everywhere; Cuno, the hoody who throws stones at corpses and arrogantly demonstrates to you; Bird's Nest Roy, the pawnshop owner who was part of the EMTs and needs to wear glasses all the time to treat radiation sickness; the bookshop girl who has no chance of education; Measurehead, the Samaritan supremacist who believes he is a super-race in the world; the rich man (Mega Rich Light-bending Guy) in the port container distorted by a high economic coefficient and huge money possession; the art creator living in the boiler room; the worker's wife waiting for her husband to come home, the dead male worker in the fishing village, and us who can't bear to tell this truth.  

Beyond these descriptions, the deeper reality is the pallor and powerlessness of being a player who has experienced and felt all this and found that there is nothing that can be done to change anything. The union boss, who are elected in turn through twin brothers, have become just another "Wild Pines", while the uneducated workers who are on strike under the leadership of the union have no idea what it means to join a board as a group. To add insult to injury, some union members are well aware that the union boss, Evrart Claire, is not "clean" at all, yet believe that this corruption is for the good of all, and that they are even grateful. In this cruel and chaotic world, anything that is noble and pure is considered false and moralistic corruption.  

In such a reality, who am I? Why on earth did Harrier, as the protagonist, become this way? These questions are revealed quite naturally. The detective with a double honour, who has lived through the fall of the Revachol commune, a human purgatory, an economic boom, a disco binge and another economic collapse, the loss of his fiancée, the confusion of reality that leaves him hysterically hungover, shouting "tequila sunset" and finally suffering from retrograde amnesia.  

Chaos repeats itself in Harrier's dreams for seven days, the last day dreaming of his ex-fiancée. When Harrier tries to kiss her, it may or may not work, but in the end it is irrevocable because it was lost long ago. In the years leading up to the amnesia, we can imagine if it was he who went through the torture and trauma of such memories on a daily basis, going on alcohol, drugs and hysteria until oblivion. This is the reality of Harrier's world of Disco Elysium, and the reality of many Eastern European residents.  

As production team ZA/UM say, the prototype for Disco Elysium came from team members who grew up in the former Soviet era - growing up reading Soviet-era science fiction, envisioning a new life in the future, and ultimately witnessing the disintegration of the entire Union. All of this has influenced the presentation of the city of Revachol, a metropolis that has gone through various stages of baptism, from the fall of the royal family to the failure of the revolution. And now, it is controlled by the so-called Free Market Union from abroad. The population is struggling to survive in poverty and losing itself in the clash of differing political views. It is by no means a happy place, but we know it all too well - isn't that what Eastern Europe has been or is going through?

# 3 Power and Rights in Politics

With the whole worldview built up, as a player I am amazed at how straightforward and brilliant the way it touched on "politics" is.  

"The most direct manifestation and means of 'politics' is the form of rule or regime. Revachol is very clearly a mapping of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Whereas the evachol of the past was a monarchy, the present Revachol is the ruins of a failed communist revolution and a liberal economy. After the destruction of the commune, the League of Nations became the masters of Revachol and formed the RCM (Revachol Citizens' Armed Forces) to maintain order in the city in a state of anarchy. From the economic boom of the 1930s to the economic collapse of the 1940s, disco was a lively dance music when it was booming, but today it is a shadow in the daylight in a pale ruin. Violent turmoil, ethnic diversity, the departure of the old order and a new one yet to come, both royalist and communist are lost.  

In the customary Chinese understanding of 'politics', 'politics' is justified, righteous, correct and worthy, and the ruler should have an upright heart to care for the order of the country and to safeguard the interests of the people by means of governance and control.It is ironic that in 'Rewasho', where 'politics' in the sense of polity is least present, the people who live there are deeply influenced by the politics of the past, in terms of ideas and positions, but are ultimately left in the most confused state.  

Further, 'politics' is a game of gaining power or losing it. State politics governs public power, and the attribution of this ruling power is fundamental to politics. In the post-Machiavellian era, political power in the modern era has rarely been about whether or not the acquisition of power is justified; it is human nature to seek power or strength. No matter how insidious or morally illegitimate the purpose, it is the reality of politics to have the initiative to pursue power, to make various resources work for you, and ultimately to acquire and maintain power that does not belong to you.  

In _Disco Elysium_, this quest for power comes through in spades. The player takes on the role of Harrier, a police detective, who goes around to find out the truth about the case; the workers want to strike in order to gain access to the board of directors and participate in the company's decisions; the strikebreakers want to abandon the strike and get their jobs; Joyce, a representative of the Wild Pines cooperates with Harrier and uses each other in order to obtain information; the president of the union uses the hangman to plan a scheme; the scab leader is a disguised mercenary who secretly uses force to coerce the workers in order to organise a military trial against lynchings.  

The vast array of texts and interactions bring to life this vast political intrigue and game. In this decadent land, where races clash, where political positions collide, where there is a struggle to gain money and a modest existence, where there is a struggle to do whatever it takes, where there is a struggle to rack one's brains, where there is a struggle to cheat, this is politics at its best, even if some of the aims are not for power itself.  

  
  

In the Machiavellian perspective, all the seemingly bad and seemingly good people are neutral in their quest for survival and their own power in this chaotic world. But it is difficult to remain neutral when we are in dialogue with them, when we really feel the circumstances of their lives. The irony of all the power-chasing in Martinaise is that the power acquired here is not real, that power seized in a chaotic polity, in anarchy, does not lead to a better existence. Everyone, like in the ruins of a disco, under a ruined neon billboard, is in the darkest forest state of mutual suspicion and constant fear.  

This goes back to what Hobbes calls the natural state of man, who is not naturally at peace with man, but inclined to conflict, and by nature seeks endless profit and glory. In the absence of a state as a public adjudicator and enforcer, everything is communal and there are no clear and effective laws as boundaries of rights. In Martinaise there is neither an absolute force to be feared through conquest nor a common contract to concede rights out of consent, resulting in a state of nature that cannot be converted into a single will.  

The snowy, broken walls look more like the dust left behind by a blazing fire, the nobility and greatness of the monarchy burned away, but neither did the freedom and common wealth expected by the revolution. The protagonist, Harry, is a doubly glorified detective police, but he is also a ragged drunk with a hangover from the collapse of society. Moments before he collapses, Harry drives his car towards the shore, shouting at the top of his lungs that tequila sunset has arrived and that the time has come for everything to end.  

And the way in which _Disco Elysium_ presents this 'apolitical' politics is very clever. Where do these political interests and identities come from? It comes from the tension between the self and the other. The protagonist wakes up from his hangover, when the world is a blank sheet of paper, and it is through the other that his perception of self becomes clear. All the forces in Revashal too, are engaged in a political struggle through the acquisition of power and status over others. It is in the game with the other that the self gradually acquires political rationality on its way to power and glory. In this state of nature, the ambiguity of the protagonist's name at first is natural. In a world without order there is no need for a symbol to stand on; a name is just a symbol.  

This game, rooted in Soviet history, shows the logic of modern political philosophy in its fullest extent, but it brings me back even more to Aristotle's statement that "man is by nature a political animal". For Aristotle, politics must have a transcendent meaning, a good ruler with good virtues and the public good satisfied. If one does not live in a polity, one is either a self-sufficient god or an animal below man. And is Revachol, and in reality many countries or regions, not precisely a god who is hungover and suffering in the ruins, pinning his hopes on the other side, or reduced to a fallen animal?  

In short, while most games are implicitly and abstractly about politics as a plot element, Elysium Disco is purely about tearing that apart and examining it, exposing some of the most sensitive realities and emotions.  

# 4 Beyond the Game

Revachol is just one of the seven Insulinde metropolises in Elysium, and Martinaise is a very small district under Revachol. It will be interesting to see how the world of Elysium will expand in the future.  

In my search for information about the creative team, I discovered that the name ZA/UM comes from a website set up by one of the creators, Robert Kurvitz, in 2009. The word comes from the famous Russian poet of the "Silver Age", Алексе́й Елисе́евич Кручёных, from the Russian prefix "зá" (beyond) and the noun "умь" (thought), translated in English as "transreason", " transration", "beyonsense". It symbolises a transcendental, soul-derived poetry that has no definite meaning, but represents all transcendence.  

I would say that the game is to the group what the album is to a band, especially a rock band with strong personalities and aspirations. This game world is the embodiment of their personalities, everything they want to say and express is in this game: the Marxist education they received in Estonia, the old and dirty broken walls they lived in, every night with cigarettes and alcohol, mania and depression, and every inch of their past into the sea of memories.  

There is something romantic, artistic and transcendent about presenting these "realities", which are somewhat alien (in textbooks) to many players, in a more poetic form as a game for players around the world. The team had been looking for different vehicles to present this nebulous art - music, painting, fiction books, poetry - until they found the video game, a vehicle that breaks boundaries and expresses itself.
  
# 5 Conclusion  
ZA/UM's announcement for the release of the Chinese version of Disco Elysium says: "Disco Elysium is like the last letter sent by the Soviet Union, painting a picture through science fiction elements and the perspective of the game - it tells you to give up, to give in. There's not a hint of unease or hesitation - Disco Elysium is a dark adventure born of hardship and loss. Yet there are occasional glimmers of light in the cracks, a few moments of friendship in the wreckage, and no shortage of dark humour in the sighs and laments."  

In its relationship to the Soviet Union, Elysium Disco is indeed a depiction of history. History can have coincidences like a roll of the dice, where a chance or a word may change the course of everyone's actions and, in the end, the course of the city and the world. History can also have the powerlessness of not being able to reach it again and again. Nor is history a pale account of every broken heart, every confused soul, with a nostalgic or sentimental view of the past and an unattainable expectation of the future. In the same history, the memories of different people are different footnotes to the history of a city.  

But Disco Elysium is at the same time the reality and the future, a future in which we are not sure if communism will make a comeback. Revachol could be the symbol of any place where dreams are extinguished, any person in any place, be it Estonia where the production team is based, other post-Soviet Eastern European countries, or the disorder and darkness of the past, present and possible future. And the Beat Generation, dancing to the rhythm of disco and sinking into the sweetness of cocktails, is not just the past, but any possible loss of self in the future.  

Writing this always feels as if Elysium Disco as a game would be too heavy, very pessimistic and bleak. But playing slowly and slowly, one gradually discovers what the production team calls the tender core inside the game: Cuno who at first calls you a pig, after seeing that you respect him, will negotiate with you like a little adult, making you bend down and listen to him; when we go out of our way to archive and read multiple judgments just to succeed in singing a song to Kim. When the veteran sits alone on a rock by the shore after the coup conflict, saying that the bastard must have gone to hell while bawling that I still love him, even though we've been enemies all our lives. When we danced disco together in church.  

I felt that it did make my life a little better.  

A while ago, an Disco Elysium player event was held at a record shop in Shanghai, hosted by two young girls who love the game. Hundreds of Disco Elysium players, each showing off their skills for what they love, immersing themselves in a vibrant group, spilling their love and life, and having fun from the heart. There was some improvised singing, some of it worked, some of it was a big flop, but either way it was great because it was very disco. Disco can be crazy, it can be collapsing, but most of all it's gloriously free.  

Doesn't it, it makes our lives, all of us, a little better?
